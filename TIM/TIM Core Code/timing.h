 * @defgroup timing Timing module
 *
 * This module provides some very basic functions to make timing easier. Several
 * other modules rely on the services provided by this module.
 *
 * The module uses the HAL layer to provide the hardware specific functionality for the
 * timing module.  In this module, the hal_timing.c file is included to allow the ISR
 * to access the time variable without externing the variable or making a function call.
 * This allows the ISR to be very efficient.

 * again for the next timer rollover. TimeSince() will result in a shorter time
 * than expected if the timer is allowed to naturally roll over after calling
 * TimerRoll. The difference will be MAX_TIME - the time when TimerRoll was last
 * called. This could be fixed by adding a check for the timer rolling over naturally
 * and setting rollover_time to TIME_MAX in timing.c. Note: This is handled by the
 * task management system which typically will be the only user of Timing_Roll()
