.PP 
User/Manufacturer defined file tuned specifically for the Transducer used\&. 

A user who wishes to utilize the TIM Architecture laai out in the TIM_CORE files must have this file located inside the compilers file system upon building\&. This file has the templates for each of the core functions as laid out by the IEEE P24151-2 standard\&. By utilizing this approach to implementation, the end-user only has to modify small amount of code, whilst leaving the core functionality alone\&. All function names as laid out in this file MUST remain the same, as these functions are called by the TIM_CORE\&.
