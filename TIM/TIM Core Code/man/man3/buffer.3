.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This module implements a software FIFO buffer of bytes\&. It provides methods \fBPush()\fP and \fBPop()\fP to add and remove bytes from the buffer\&.
.PP
The user is responsible for allocating the structure used to manage the buffer, \fBbuffer_t\fP, as well as the actual byte array which will be used to implement the buffer\&. These are then passed to \fBBufferInit()\fP which must be called prior to any attempts to Push or Pop\&.
.PP
There is also a \fBPushData()\fP method which allows multiple bytes to be added to the buffer at once\&.
.PP
An alternative to this FIFO byte buffer is the Item Buffer module which works the same except with items of any size instead of being limited to bytes only\&.

.SS "void BufferSetCallback (\fBbuffer_t\fP * buffer, void(*)(\fBbuffer_t\fP *buffer) Callback)"
Set Callback function for buffer to be called after items are Push'd to the buffer
.PP
The callback function will be called after anything is Push'd to the buffer\&. The function will be called with a pointer to the buffer which had an item pushed onto it\&.
.PP
Example: 
.PP
.nf
1 void TxCallback(buffer_t * buf);
2 #define TX_BUFFER_LENGTH 512
3 buffer_t tx; // transmit buffer
4 char tx_buffer_array[TX_BUFFER_LENGTH]
5 \&.\&.\&.
6 BufferInit(&tx, &tx_buffer_array[0], TX_BUFFER_LENGTH);
7 BufferSetCallback(&tx, TxCallback);
8 \&.\&.\&.
9 void TxCallback(buffer_t * buf) {
10         SET_UART_TX_IE();
11 }

.fi
.PP
 This example is useful for a uC which has a hardware Tx interrupt flag which is set whenever there is room in the hardware Tx FIFO buffer\&. When done transmitting the interrupt must be disabled to avoid getting stuck in the ISR\&. When data needs to be sent the interrupt must be enabled again, thus the need for the callback\&.
.PP
Another usage could be to handle received data on a receive buffer\&.
.PP
\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
many applications may use the Push method in a ISR which means the Callback would be called from a ISR\&. Thus care should be taken to ensure callbacks are both fast and interrupt safe

Pop will return one item from the front of the FIFO buffer
.PP
Pop will return the item at the front of the FIFO buffer then increment (and wrap as needed) the front\&. If the buffer is empty it will return 0\&.
.PP
\fBBufferInit()\fP must be used to initialize the buffer prior to calling Pop and passing it a pointer to the buffer\&.

Push will add one item, data, to the FIFO buffer

Push will add one item to the rear of the data buffer then increment (and wrap is needed) the rear\&. If the buffer is full it will overwrite the data at the front of the buffer and increment the front\&.

Push a array of data to the buffer

\fBWarning:\fP
.RS 4
PushData will disable interrupts while writing to the buffer\&. If length is long this could interfere with time sensitive ISRs\&. Consider using \fBPush()\fP if this is an issue\&.
.RE
.PP
PushData will add an array of items to the rear of the data buffer and increment (and wrap if needed) the rear\&. If the buffer does not have room none of the data will be pushed to the buffer\&.
