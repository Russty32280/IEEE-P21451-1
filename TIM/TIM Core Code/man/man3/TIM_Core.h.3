Core functionality for a P21451-2 TIM utilizing MSP430 Architecture\&. 

This file contains the core funcitonality to communicate from an NCAP to a TIM over UART\&. The current implementaiton is limited in its funcitonality, however, as more work is done, we will continue to update this file\&. The Transducer Interface Module (TIM) is one of the three main entities in a IEEE P21451 Smart Transducer Network\&. The heirarchy of this network can be seen in the figure below\&. This TIM will communicate to only ONE NCAP, however, it is not limited to just communication over UART\&.
.PP
Currently, this implementation only supports ReadTransducerChannelData, WriteTransducerChannelData, ReadMetaTEDS, and MetaTEDSInit\&. This was done to show the core functionality behind the network, and also lay out the foundation for future work\&.
.PP
To test out this code, open up a UART Channel with putty with Baud Rate 115200 and use the following syntax for sending messages:
.PP
'$XXX,YYY' Where XXX is a function ID, and YYY is a channel ID\&. Currently the only functionIDs supported are '000', '128', '160' for 'Write to all transducers/Write to a specific Channel', 'Read all Transducers/Read Specific Transducer', 'Reading Meta/Channel TEDS' respectively\&. What determines which function each message commands (X/Y) is the ChannelID\&. If the ChannelID = 000, then it is assumed that the NCAP wants global functionality, otherwise it performs local functions\&.
.PP
Some of the functions will only reply over UART a success message which currently are place holders for the proper response\&.
.PP
It is reccomended that for testing the code, you turn on Local Echo and well as local line editing in your serial terminal\&.
