This repository will be maintained by the students while adding more functionality to the exisiting code. The repository will be split into 6 main branches as students work on parts of the standard:
* Identification Services
* Transducer Access Services
* TEDS Access Services
* Event Notification Services
* Transducer Management Services
* Proof-of-Concept Implementations

Groups will work on these branches improving the functionality of the exisiting code and merge updates as they are tested and verified.
