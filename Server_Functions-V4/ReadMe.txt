These python files contain the 
code for the different P21451-1 
Service Functions. The code was 
written during Spring 2015. Some of 
the Service Functions do no have all
the services listed in the dot10 version
of the draft due to time constraints 
as well as limitations of the model 
implemented. If there are any questions
regarding the service functions code, 
please email 'muhame76@students.rowan.edu'

This code was designed to be implemented 
alongside the NCAP Server main driver
created and modified by Tom Stoudt.
